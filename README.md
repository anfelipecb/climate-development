# Heat, Households, and Human Development

Andrés Felipe Camacho

## Description

This project visualizes the relationship between rising temperatures and their impacts on family life and child development. Using linked climate and household survey data, it explores two critical questions: (1) How does heat exposure affect parenting behaviors and discipline practices? (2) How does heat influence early childhood development outcomes?

The interactive data story combines global temperature trends, spatial data linkage methodology, and exploratory patterns that motivated two research papers on heat's effects on violent child punishment and developmental delays. The visualizations reveal that temperature impacts are not uniformly distributed—they concentrate among vulnerable populations including poorer households, urban dwellers, and communities without adequate water and sanitation infrastructure.

This work demonstrates how climate change is not just an environmental issue, but a human development crisis affecting the most vulnerable children from their earliest years.
